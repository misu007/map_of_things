#Name
Map of Things (動くモノの地図 in Japanese)

#Description
Map of Things is a Salesforce Lightning Component which provides a map including customizable markers and pop-ups using [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com).
This can express anything's behavior on a digital map in real time.
For example, it would enable that markers in the map move durably depending on cars in the real world.
It would help you easily catch the essence from a massive information brought by IoT.
